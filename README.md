## What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system. they are configurations for various applications. 

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.

## How you manage your dotfiles?

There are a hundred ways to manage your dotfiles.
